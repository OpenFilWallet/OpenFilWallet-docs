# Token

In order to increase the security of the wallet, the token issued by the wallet service must be carried when making a request for the wallet service.&#x20;

Token permissions are divided into multiple levels: read, write, sign, admin.

This function is useful for secondary development based on wallet services. For users, there is no need to care about this function, because `openfil-cli` does everything.
